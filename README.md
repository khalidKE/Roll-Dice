## Roll Dice
A simple Flutter app that simulates rolling a dice. The app displays a dice image and allows the user to roll the dice by pressing a button. Each roll randomly selects a dice face from a set of images and updates the display accordingly.

## Features

Use of Flutter's StatefulWidget to manage state changes.

## The app consists of the following files:

main.dart: The main entry point of the application.
roll_dice.dart: Contains the RollDice widget which displays the dice image and a button to roll the dice.


## Assets
